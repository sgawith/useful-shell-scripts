# Useful shell scripts

## What?

A selection of potentially useful shell scripts, covering a variety of functions.

## Why?

I'm always producing simple but useful little scripts in the course of various projects, but after using them for a while, I move on to a new project and forget what I've done. To save time in the future and to improve my work, I thought I'd start saving them in a non-project-specific repository.

## When?

Working on it - it'll build up slowly. One script today, and more will be added as & when I think of it.
